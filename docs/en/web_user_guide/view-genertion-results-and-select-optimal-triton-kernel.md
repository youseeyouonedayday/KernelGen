# View generation results and select optimal Kernel

When the statuses of the **Kernel**, **CUDA Implementation**, **Correctness Test**, and **Speedup Ratio Test** change to **Completed**, the Kernel is generated successfully. Then, you can evaluate the testing results and select an optimal Kernel.

Perform the following steps to view the testing results and select an optimal Kernel:

- If **Correctness Test** turns green, the correctness is passed. Then, check whether the overall **Speedup Test** meets your expectations.

  - If the overall **Speedup Test** meets your expectations, perform the following steps:
    1. Click the **View Details** to view the speedup of each scenario.

    2. If the speedup of each scenario also meets your expectations, click **Download Kernel** on the top to download the Kernel code for future use. If you want to use the correctness test and speedup ratio test results, click **Correctness Test** and **Speedup Ratio Test** sections to copy and paste the corresponding codes.
  
  - If the overall **Speedup Test** does not meet your expectations, in the **Kernel** code section, modify the Kernel code and then click **Speedup Test** to start a new iteration.
    If there are multiple iterations, you can select one of these iterations and click **Use this code** on this iteration. Once the corresponding Kernel code appears in the **Kernel** section, click **Download Kernel** at the top to download the Kernel code for future use.

- If the **Correctness Test** turns red, you can manually modify the Kernel code in the **Kernel** section, and then click **Correctness Test** to start another iteration till the correctness is passed, and download the Kernel.

```{note}
 If your current kernel modifications don’t meet your expectations, you can click an entry in the History section at left to revert to and modify an earlier version of the kernel code.
